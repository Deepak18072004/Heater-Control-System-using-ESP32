# üî• Heater Control System ‚Äì ESP32 Project

This project implements a basic heater control system using an **ESP32**, a **DHT22 temperature sensor**, and an **OLED display**. The system uses a finite state machine to control a simulated heater and broadcasts its current state over **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**.

## üìå Features

- ‚úÖ Real-time temperature monitoring using DHT22
- ‚úÖ Finite State Machine with 5 states:
  - `IDLE`
  - `HEATING`
  - `STABILIZING`
  - `TARGET_REACHED`
  - `OVERHEAT`
- ‚úÖ Heater control via GPIO pin (simulated by LED)
- ‚úÖ OLED display showing:
  - System state
  - Current temperature
  - Heater status
- ‚úÖ BLE advertising of current heater state (visible via BLE scanner apps)
- ‚úÖ Status LED feedback (Green LED ON when heater is active)
- ‚úÖ FreeRTOS task handles periodic sensor reading and state update

## üñ•Ô∏è Pin Configuration

| Module     | ESP32 GPIO |
|------------|------------|
| DHT22      | GPIO 16    |
| Heater LED | GPIO 12    |
| Status LED | GPIO 14    |

## üì° BLE Functionality

- BLE broadcasts the **current system state** (e.g., `HeaterState: HEATING`)
- You can view it using:
  - [nRF Connect](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile)
  - LightBlue Explorer
  - BLE Scanner (Android/iOS)

> BLE advertising does not require pairing or connection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Behavior

| Condition                     | Action                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Temp < 26¬∞C                  | Start Heating                   |
| Temp ‚â• 28¬∞C                  | Stop Heating ‚Üí Stabilizing      |
| Temp stable after threshold  | Move to Target Reached state    |
| Temp ‚â• 50¬∞C                  | Overheat protection triggers    |

## üß™ How to Use

1. Connect all components as per the pin config above.
2. Flash the code using **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 board support.
3. Open the **Serial Monitor** to view logs.
4. Observe:
   - OLED display for status
   - Heater LED (ON when heating)
   - BLE broadcast on your phone (via app)

## üö¶ Libraries Used

- `DHT.h` ‚Äì For DHT22 sensor
- `Adafruit_SSD1306` ‚Äì For OLED display
- `Adafruit_GFX` ‚Äì Graphics support for OLED
- `BLEDevice.h` ‚Äì For BLE advertisement (ESP32 built-in)
- `FreeRTOS` ‚Äì Task scheduler (ESP32 built-in)

---

## üîó Notes

- BLE advertising is not supported on Wokwi; test on **real ESP32 hardware**
- If OLED or BLE is not needed, the code can be simplified
- Ensure the correct **board settings** are selected in Arduino IDE:
  - Board: ESP32 Dev Module
  - Upload Speed: 115200 or 921600
  - Partition Scheme: Default
