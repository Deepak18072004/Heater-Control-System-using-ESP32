# Heater-Control-System-using-ESP32
A smart embedded system project built on ESP32 to simulate heater control based on ambient temperature. It uses a DHT22 sensor for temperature readings, an OLED display for real-time feedback, the current heater state. The system runs on a FreeRTOS task loop for non-blocking periodic updates.
